# MiniGPT
## Introduction

This project explores the implementation of a mini-GPT model, a simplified version of the powerful GPT-2 architecture.  It demonstrates the implementation of a generative pre-trained transformer model capable of text generation at a character level. This project covers aspects from data preparation, tokenization, model building, training, to generating new text based on trained models.
